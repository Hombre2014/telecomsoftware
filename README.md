# Telecommunication software GmbH programming challenge

>  Programming challenge for a software developer position.

## Description

Programming Evaluation
This exercise consists of 3 consecutive steps.
You don‚Äôt have to master all steps ‚Äì solve the exercise as far as you can.
samwin naturally stores names including umlauts. Older devices are sometimes not capable of handling umlauts and send names with umlauts replaced (√Ñ .. AE, √ñ .. OE, √ú .. UE, √ü .. SS).
To find these names in the database, the replacement letters have to be converted to their umlaut counterparts.
Names are stored in capital letters.
Step 1
Develop a program which converts the replacement letters into their umlaut counterparts.
You can define whether ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 encoding is to be used.
Examples:
KOESTNER -> K√ñSTNER
RUESSWURM -> R√ú√üWURM
Step 2
Since names might exist that contain the replacement letters, a list of possible variations has to be generated for any given name.
Develop a program which generates a list of all possible variations of a given name.
Examples:
KOESTNER -> (KOESTNER, K√ñSTNER)
RUESSWURM -> (RUESSWURM, R√ú√üWURM, RUE√üWURM, R√úSSWURM)
Step 3
A SQL statement used to search for a name might look like this:
SELECT * FROM tbl_phonebook WHERE last_name = 'RUESSWURM'
Extend your program from step 2 to generate a SQL statement to search for all variations of a given name.
Please send us your source code as well as the output for each step using the following names:
KOESTNER
RUESSWURM
DUERMUELLER
JAEAESKELAEINEN
GROSSSCHAEDL
